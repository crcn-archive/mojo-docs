### Unit Tests

Tests smaller parts of your application without worrying too much about how each unit of code interacts with each other. 

### E2E Tests

E2E, or End to End tests are useful since they ensure every unit of code works together as a whole. At ClassDojo, we generally write
e2e tests for core features of the website such as basic login, signup, forgot & reset password. Everything else that is
front-end specific is usually written as a unit test.
