You now have an application that's ready to be wired up. You might be noticing a bit of a pattern - allow me to spell it out. The philosophy behind writing mojo-based applications
is to only focus on what's needed immediately in the application, instead of focusing on the entire application structure. We first wrote out our HTML, then broke it out into separate
views bit-by-bit. Now we're onto writing models & collections which provide a data-layer for our application.
