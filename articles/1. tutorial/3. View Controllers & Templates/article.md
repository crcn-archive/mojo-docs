Now it's time to write some code! We'll start off with writing the first view controller - `app/views/main/index.js`.

After some code...

Your application shouldn't depend on view controllers, and view controllers shouldn't be depend on each another.
You should realistically be able to remove *just about* any view controller, and still maintain a fully functional application.
