Mojo.js is a JavaScript framework for building Single Page Applications, or static websites in Node.js. The core is small, while third-party modules allow you to customize Mojo depending on your requirements. Mojo was built initially to phase out old code, and itself - hence the modularity. The philosophy behind Mojo is to allow you to build on top of your old code base, and slowly strangle out your old application until you have a new, highly maintainable application.
