Mojo.js is a Customizable JavaScript framework inspired by Node.js and Backbone.js. The framework is entirely modular - everything is broken out into smaller, more manageable libraries that allow you, the engineer to cherry-pick exactly what features you want to use for your application. These libraries include the [application](https://github.com/classdojo/mojo-application), [models](https://github.com/classdojo/mojo-model), [views](https://github.com/classdojo/mojo-views), [template engine](https://github.com/classdojo/mojo-paperclip), [router](https://github.com/classdojo/mojo-router). These libraries were designed to work well with one-another, but not depend on each other. This means that you can even use your own models, views, template engine, or router, and Mojo.js will play nicely with them. 

<br />

Mojo.js was designed with the [Strangler Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html) in mind. If you already have a pre-existing application, you can easily build Mojo on-top of it without a full, application re-write. Meaning you can slowly ease into it without worrying about the all-or-nothing approach associated with most JavaScript frameworks.
